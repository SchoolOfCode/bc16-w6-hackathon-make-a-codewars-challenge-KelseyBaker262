// Hello challenger!
// Due to everyone getting pets during the Covid pandemic in 2020 a vetenary practice been struggling with the demands on their services. They have decided to unregister all pets from their system who haven't had an appointment in the last 3 years.

// // Its your task to be given an array of pets, identify if they last visited the vets over 3 years before todays date and return the following string:

// "Mowgli has not visited in 3 years and needs to be taken off the register."

// Things to remember:
// *The pet must only be taken off the register if they haven't visited in 3 years

// *The name of the pet must be stated in the output string

// *The array of pets will be like:

// const visitDatesArray = [
//     { name: "Mowgli", lastVisit: "2019-05-15" },
//     { name: "Socks", lastVisit: "2021-02-20" },
//     { name: "Bertie", lastVisit: "2023-02-20" },
//     { name: "Simba", lastVisit: "2018-10-10" }
// ];

export function checkVetsVisits(visitDatesArray) {
  // Good luck!
}
